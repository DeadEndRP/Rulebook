- Metagaming includes the following:
  - Knowing a character’s name because you can see it in chat box. 
  - Knowing the exact location and names of other characters because your previous dead character knew them. 
  - Using/sharing screenshots of in-game locations to use and gain an advtange over other players, such as: Where to attack their base.

     - Being completly careless or fearless with your character in a potentially scary situiation.
     - Focusing specifically on skill grinding to "power build" to give you an adnvatage in RP situations.

# PVP RULES

This is NOT a PvP-oriented server, but PvP is allowed as long as it makes sense for your character and that you have a VALID reason to do so.**
All players have the choice whether their character's death is permanent or not, UNLESS they have lost their choice to Permadeath (Read our Life for Life & Permadeath rules)

Before you initiate PvP we **highly recommend** you take screenshots or screen recordings as proof of PvP warning as well as Permadeath agreement or disagreement. Many things can go wrong with a pvp moment– lag and desync can lead to someone getting shot in the head versus the leg as emoted, or depending on someone’s traits, they can near-instantly die, among other issues. 

PLEASE remember that we are a roleplay server and we are here to have fun. Don’t hop into a vc and start bickering with one another. Don’t throw insults and threats. Be mature and we can talk out our differences between characters OOC if need be. **OOC =/= IC**.  If you have issues, reach out to an admin and we can do what we can to help, or even supervise a pvp session. 

**Please keep in mind our general server rules before engaging in PvP.** 

- No Metagaming
- No Powergaming
- No KOS
- No PvP Logging - if you need to leave for IRL reasons let the player know using /looc and discuss with them on continuing the encounter at another time.
- Make a meaningful and realistic scene.
- No Trolling or immersion breaking.

A valid reason to start PVP is not just your character's background. You must have a valid reason. 
For example: What purpose does it serve? Why is there conflict? What has led to cause violence to occur?

**Unacceptable reason for PvP**
-----------------------------
- "This person flipped me off and now I wanna kill them."

**Acceptable reasons for PvP**
-----------------------------
- "An individual is continuing to be aggressive despite warnings to stop."
- "A person has, in text roleplay, used violence against my character or someone they care about."

### 4.1 KOS (Kill On Sight) is NOT allowed and never will be.
- Before engaging in PvP, you must make a meaningful and realistic scene and an acceptable escalation reason is needed. 
- You cannot shoot anyone just because they denied PvP or aren't handing over their stuff, if you are caught KOS anyone you will be given a strike.

### 4.2  All players must give a Conditional PVP WARNING prior to engaging in PVP
Conditional PVP Warning is a warning to another player that PVP MAY HAPPEN depending on the escalation or outcome of a scene.
- If a situation has escalated to possible violence, you MUST give a Conditional PVP Warning by using /looc in the text chat to let the other player know PvP is active BEFORE engaging in any PVP.
- The person who tells the other player PVP is active must also receive a reply back in OOC form, BEFORE they can escalate the situation further and engage in PVP. 
Prior to  weapons being drawn and aimed at one another or threats being made, a pvp warning MUST be sent.
- The person who gives the PVP warning must also ask using /looc, if their character accepts permadeath during PVP or not.

- Example of how to Initiate PVP:
  - Player 1 - “/looc PVP is on and it may happen, perma?.”
  - Player 2 - “/looc okay, my pvp is active too, No perma.”
  
- From here players must then emote their actions before engaging in PVP:
  - Player 1 - “/me draws their gun and aims it at the person in front.”
  - Player 2 - "/me also draws their gun and aims their gun.”

- Some situations only require one side to enable PvP to avoid friendly fire. 
  - For example:
    -  If a PvP escalation involves multiple players versus one, use /looc to agree that the 1 solo person will enable PvP to avoid one side shooting their friends.
    -  If a group of NPCs played by staff are involved, only the staff will enable PvP. This prevents players accidentally shooting each other.

From this point the players may engage if they so choose to.

### 4.3 Let others know if you have hidden teammates.
- If a situation involves multiple players initiating PVP, with one roleplaying a sniper, when letting the other player know that PVP is active they must also tell them they have a friend with them who is a sniper. The player who is a sniper cannot engage in PVP until they see their teammate engaging in PVP. 
  - For example:
    - Player 1 “/looc PVP is on and it may happen, I have a teammate who is a sniper. Perma?.”
    - Player 2 "- “/looc okay, my pvp is active too, No perma.”

- We heavily encourage players to not spam shoot someone, if someone is on the ground we encourage both sides to realistically play out the scene without finishing each other off, by roleplaying injuries. However this isn't enforced, it is just heavily encouraged.
- ALWAYS SCREENSHOT PVP warning with the chat box visible. If not, admins cannot help you if things go wrong.

- Remember there are other ways to deal with players than having to shoot them, you may also opt to; Demand they drop their weapons/bags, take them hostage for ransom or Torture (Please follow our Torutre rules before doing this!) 

  - For example: 
    - "Drop your guns and leave," or "Never come back here again."
    - “Get in my truck. I'm taking you hostage.” or “Hands behind your back and walk forward.”
   
-  Staff and NPC characters are also subject to these rules.
- Bystanders cannot not attempt to join into the middle of a PvP scenario such as a firefight if they were not involved in any RP escalation beforehand. Project Zomboid PvP is not the best and mistakes can be made!

### 4.4 During PvP  
Under no circumstances, Explosives are NOT allowed in PvP.
Explosives have a high chance of causing widespread damage, Explosives are too powerful and will not result in a fair fight.

- If you die via PvP this does not mean you are Permadeath unless you have either: 
Agreed to permadeath.
Lost your choice to permadeath following our “Life for Life Rule”

### 4.5 After PVP 

- Winner in PVP

  - If you win and the other person agrees to permadeath, you will lose your choice to permadeath for the foreseeable future with that character, following our Life for Life Rules. This means anyone who would be affiliated with the person in a positive way, and witnesses their death by you or has been given overwhelming proof you killed them permanently, they would be able to permadeath your character in future PVP scenarios if they win a PVP encounter against you, as you lost your choice to permadeath.

- If you won the PVP, and you wish to loot the player, visit and READ our Theft/Robbery Rules.

- Loser in PVP
  - If you die during PvP and you have NOT lost your choice to Permadeath and do NOT want to rule the death as permadeath, then please make a staff assistance post asking for a TP to your body so you can retrieve your old items. 

- The loser can be given injuries upon their character or they can “RP the injuries”. This means the player will be injured and CANNOT attempt to attack the winner as revenge straight away, once they gather their belongings. Please make sure the winner of the PVP has finished looting your backpack before picking it up.

- If you died during PVP and you accepted permadeath or had previously lost your choice to permadeath then that character is permanently dead. Please let an admin know so they can remove your dead characters whitelist so you can then submit a new character to be whitelisted
